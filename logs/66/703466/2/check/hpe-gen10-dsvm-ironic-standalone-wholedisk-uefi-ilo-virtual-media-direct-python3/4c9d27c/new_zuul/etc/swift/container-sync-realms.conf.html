# Each section name is the name of a sync realm. A sync realm is a set of
# clusters that have agreed to allow container syncing with each other. Realm
# names will be considered case insensitive.
#
# The key is the overall cluster-to-cluster key used in combination with the
# external users' key that they set on their containers' X-Container-Sync-Key
# metadata header values. These keys will be used to sign each request the
# container sync daemon makes and used to validate each incoming container sync
# request.
#
# The key2 is optional and is an additional key incoming requests will be
# checked against. This is so you can rotate keys if you wish; you move the
# existing key to key2 and make a new key value.
#
# Any values in the realm section whose names begin with cluster_ will indicate
# the name and endpoint of a cluster and will be used by external users in
# their containers' X-Container-Sync-To metadata header values with the format
# "realm_name/cluster_name/container_name". Realm and cluster names are
# considered case insensitive.
#
# The endpoint is what the container sync daemon will use when sending out
# requests to that cluster. Keep in mind this endpoint must be reachable by all
# container servers, since that is where the container sync daemon runs. Note
# that the endpoint ends with /v1/ and that the container sync daemon will then
# add the account/container/obj name after that.
#
# Distribute this container-sync-realms.conf file to all your proxy servers
# and container servers.
